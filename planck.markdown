# Planck and I

## Hello world

- First friction log ever
- First time using Gitlab
- First time using Planck
- First time using Clojure(Script) at all
- So a lot can go wrong here
- And I take all the blame for it from the outset
- Everyone else involved is amazing and I appreciate greatly everything you do
  :)
