***** Finished reading /[[http://learnyouahaskell.com][Learn You a Haskell for Great Good]]/. :lyahfgg:

****** A page a day sometimes. Took me months.
****** Didn't write a single line of code, just getting the general idea. Liked the book.
****** Wrote a bit more about it on [[https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%2525%252FsE5Z7f2QIlsBBdsecIC5aMsroE%252Btvl147t7WiOnC7o%253D.sha256][scuttlebutt]].
